# Technical Specifications: Flashpoint Network

## 1. Network Architecture

*   **Type:** An independent app-chain built using the **Cosmos SDK**.
    *   **Rationale:** This framework provides maximum sovereignty and flexibility to build a completely custom consensus mechanism and application layer, which is essential for the project's core innovations. It avoids the constraints imposed by inheriting the consensus rules of a parent chain.

## 2. Consensus Mechanism: "Proof of Optimal Execution" (PoOE)

This is a modified version of Tendermint Proof-of-Stake.

*   **Validators (Block Producers):** In Flashpoint, validators are called **Sequencers**. They are responsible for ordering and executing transactions.
*   **Transaction Submission:**
    *   Traders submit "transaction intents" or "bundles" to the Sequencers' private mempool. An intent is a declarative statement of a desired outcome (e.g., "Swap asset A for B on DEX 1, then B for C on DEX 2, only if the final amount of C is greater than X").
    *   This protects traders from generic front-running as their strategy is not broadcast publicly.
*   **Block Proposal Logic:**
    1.  During the `PrepareProposal` phase, a Sequencer receives multiple intents from traders.
    2.  The Sequencer runs a sophisticated off-chain algorithm to simulate thousands of possible orderings of these intents to find the combination that maximizes the total arbitrage profit extracted within the block.
    3.  The Sequencer constructs a block with this optimal ordering.
*   **Incentive Structure:**
    *   Sequencers earn a percentage (e.g., 5-10%) of the *extra* profit they generate for the trader through optimal ordering (the "surplus value").
    *   This directly aligns the Sequencer's incentives with the traders'. The better a Sequencer is at optimizing execution, the more they earn.

## 3. Co-location as a Service

*   **Architecture:** A permissioned sub-network of **Execution Nodes**.
*   **Node Operators:** Operators must stake the network's native token (`FLSH`) and pass a technical audit verifying their low-latency connection to major L1 nodes (e.g., Ethereum, Solana).
*   **Trader Access:** Traders stake `FLSH` tokens to gain the right to deploy and run their proprietary trading algorithms within a sandboxed WebAssembly (WASM) environment on these Execution Nodes. The amount of `FLSH` staked could correspond to the computational resources allocated to their bot.
*   **Security:** The WASM environment ensures that a trader's bot can only interact with approved blockchain APIs and cannot access the underlying system or other traders' bots.

## 4. Shared Signal Intelligence Layer

*   **Technology:** **ZK-SNARKs** (specifically, using the Circom & snarkjs libraries for ease of development).
*   **Process Flow:**
    1.  A trader's bot ("Scout") identifies a potential arbitrage opportunity.
    2.  The Scout generates a ZK-proof. The **public inputs** to the proof might be `[DEX_A_ID, DEX_B_ID, estimated_profit_tier]`, where `estimated_profit_tier` is a category like "small," "medium," or "large." The **private inputs** would be the specific assets and trade amounts.
    3.  The proof attests: "I know a specific arbitrage path involving DEX A and DEX B that results in a profit within the 'medium' tier."
    4.  This proof is submitted to the **Signal Contract** on-chain.
    5.  Other bots on the network can use these public hints to focus their own search, without the original Scout revealing its full strategy.
    6.  The Sequencer that executes a profitable trade bundle can programmatically attribute a portion of the profit back to the wallet that first submitted the relevant signal proof.

## 5. Tokenomics (`$FLSH`)

*   **Utility:**
    1.  **Staking:** For Sequencers to produce blocks and for Execution Node operators to provide co-location services.
    2.  **Access:** For traders to pay for transaction execution and to stake for access to the co-located Execution Nodes.
    3.  **Governance:** For voting on network upgrades, fee structures, and other protocol parameters.
*   **Value Accrual:** A percentage of all arbitrage profits captured and surplus value generated by Sequencers is sent to the network treasury. The treasury can be used for `FLSH` token buy-and-burn programs or distributed as rewards to stakers, creating a direct link between network activity and token value.
