# How to Build: Flashpoint Network

This guide outlines the development process in distinct, manageable phases.

## Phase 1: Core Research & Simulation (Months 1-3)

**Objective:** Validate the core concepts before writing a single line of blockchain code.

1.  **Tech Stack Deep Dive:**
    *   Confirm **Cosmos SDK** is the optimal choice. Analyze its ABCI++ features which allow for deep customization of the mempool and block proposal logic.
    *   Research and select a ZK-proof system. Start with **Circom/snarkjs** for rapid prototyping.
2.  **Build an Off-Chain Simulator (Python/Rust):**
    *   Create a simulation of the Flashpoint network.
    *   Model a stream of incoming "transaction intents."
    *   Implement and benchmark different sequencing algorithms for the "Proof of Optimal Execution" logic. Compare its profitability against a standard First-In-First-Out (FIFO) mempool.
    *   **Goal:** Prove that the custom consensus can generate significantly more profit than standard methods.
3.  **Prototype a ZK-Proof Circuit:**
    *   Build a simple proof using Circom that allows a user to prove they know a profitable path between two hypothetical DEXs without revealing the assets involved. This validates the feasibility of the Shared Signal Intelligence layer.

## Phase 2: Private Testnet (Months 4-9)

**Objective:** Build a functional, minimal version of the app-chain.

1.  **Scaffold the App-Chain:**
    *   Use the Cosmos SDK to create the basic blockchain. Implement the standard `bank`, `auth`, and `staking` modules.
    *   Create the native token, `$FLSH`.
2.  **Implement Custom Consensus Logic:**
    *   This is the most critical step. Modify the `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` handlers of the application.
    *   The `PrepareProposal` handler will contain the logic for the Sequencer to reorder transactions from its private mempool based on the algorithm developed in Phase 1.
3.  **Build a Basic Intent Mempool:**
    *   Develop a private gRPC endpoint for Sequencers where traders can submit their transaction intents.
4.  **Launch & Internal Testing:**
    *   Deploy the network as a private, multi-node testnet.
    *   Develop simple test bots to submit intents and confirm the custom sequencing is working as expected.

## Phase 3: Infrastructure & Public Testnet (Months 10-15)

**Objective:** Build out the ecosystem services and prepare for public use.

1.  **Develop Execution Node Software:**
    *   Create the software for Execution Node operators, including the staking mechanism for access and the sandboxed **WASM runtime** (e.g., using Wasmer or Wasmtime) for running trader bots.
2.  **Implement the Signal Contract:**
    *   Write and deploy the smart contract for the Shared Signal Intelligence layer. It will need functions to `submitProof` and `verifyProof`.
3.  **Build the Developer SDK:**
    *   Create a robust SDK in **Python and/or Rust**. This SDK should make it simple for traders to format their intents, connect to the private mempool, and interact with the co-location nodes.
4.  **Launch Public Testnet:**
    *   Invite a curated group of quantitative traders to participate.
    *   Organize a "trading competition" to stress-test the network, gather feedback, and identify bugs or economic exploits.
    *   Publish detailed documentation and tutorials.

## Phase 4: Mainnet Launch & Growth (Months 16+)

**Objective:** Go live and build the network's user base.

1.  **Conduct Security Audits:**
    *   Engage at least two reputable auditing firms to conduct a full audit of the entire system: the consensus logic, all smart contracts, and the Execution Node software.
2.  **Mainnet Launch:**
    *   Perform a genesis event and launch the Flashpoint mainnet.
    *   Bootstrap the network by partnering with initial Sequencers and Execution Node operators.
3.  **Liquidity & Integration Strategy:**
    *   The network is only useful if it can trade on liquid markets. Focus heavily on building and promoting secure, low-latency bridges to major chains like Ethereum, Solana, and others.
4.  **Ecosystem Development:**
    *   Establish a grant program funded by the network treasury to encourage the development of third-party tools, analytics dashboards, and novel trading strategies on Flashpoint.
